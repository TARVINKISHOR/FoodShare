            <h3>Causes of Food Waste</h3>

            <div class="about-tips">

                <p>Food waste occurs at various stages of the food supply chain, from production to consumption. Some
                    common
                    causes include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Overproduction:</strong> Farmers and retailers often produce more food than needed,
                        leading
                        to excess that goes to waste.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consumer Behavior:</strong> Consumers may buy more food than they can consume, leading
                        to
                        spoilage and disposal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Strict Standards:</strong> Retailers may reject produce that doesn't meet aesthetic
                        standards, even if it's perfectly edible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inadequate Storage:</strong> Poor storage conditions can lead to spoilage and waste
                        before
                        food reaches consumers.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>

            <div class="about-tips">

                <p>Food waste has significant environmental consequences:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Greenhouse Gas Emissions:</strong> Decomposing food in landfills produces methane, a
                        potent
                        greenhouse gas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resource Waste:</strong> The water, energy, and land used to produce wasted food are
                        also
                        wasted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Degradation:</strong> Excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides in food
                        production
                        can harm soil quality.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Economic Impact</h3>

            <div class="about-tips">

                <p>Food waste also has economic implications:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Financial Loss:</strong> Wasted food represents a significant financial loss for
                        producers,
                        retailers, and consumers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Increased Costs:</strong> Managing food waste incurs costs for waste collection and
                        disposal.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Missed Opportunities:</strong> Wasted food could have been used to feed those in need,
                        representing a lost opportunity to address food insecurity.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Social Impact</h3>

            <div class="about-tips">

                <p>Food waste has social consequences as well:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Food Insecurity:</strong> While food is wasted, many people around the world suffer from
                        hunger
                        and malnutrition.</li>
                    <li><strong>Community Strain:</strong> Food waste can strain community resources and contribute to
                        social
                        inequality.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural Attitudes:</strong> Societal norms around food consumption and waste can
                        perpetuate
                        wasteful behaviors.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>

            <div class="about-facts">

                <p>Did you know that the amount of food wasted globally is enough to feed 2 billion people? This
                    staggering
                    statistic highlights the urgent need to address food waste and its consequences.</p>
