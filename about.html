            <h1>Understanding Food Waste</h1>
            <p>
                Food waste is one of the most pressing environmental and social challenges of our time.
                Every year, approximately 1.3 billion tons of food is wasted globally, while millions go hungry.
            </p>

            <h3>The Scale of the Problem</h3>

                </div>

                <p>
                    Globally, one-third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted.
                    This represents not just a waste of food, but also a waste of the labor, water, energy,
                    land, and other inputs that went into producing that food.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1.3 Billion Tons:</strong> Amount of food wasted annually worldwide</li>
                    <li><strong>$940 Billion:</strong> Economic value of food wasted each year</li>
                    <li><strong>8-10%:</strong> Of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food waste</li>
                    <li><strong>30-40%:</strong> Of the food supply in developed countries is wasted</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Main Causes of Food Waste</h3>
            <div class="about-tips">
                <p>Food waste occurs throughout the entire supply chain, from farm to fork:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Agricultural Production:</strong> Weather damage, pest infestations, and crops left
                        unharvested due to market prices or cosmetic standards</li>
                    <li><strong>Processing & Manufacturing:</strong> Product defects, overproduction, and inefficient
                        processing techniques</li>
                    <li><strong>Distribution & Retail:</strong> Overstocking, cosmetic standards, damaged packaging, and
                        approaching sell-by dates</li>
                    <li><strong>Consumer Behavior:</strong> Over-purchasing, poor meal planning, confusion over date
                        labels, improper storage, and large portion sizes</li>
                    <li><strong>Food Service:</strong> Over-preparation, large portions, buffet-style service, and
                        customer plate waste</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <p>The environmental toll of food waste extends far beyond the food itself:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> When food decomposes in landfills, it produces methane—a
                        greenhouse gas 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide</li>
                    <li><strong>Water Waste:</strong> Agriculture accounts for 70% of global freshwater use. Wasted food
                        means wasted water—equivalent to the annual flow of Russia's Volga River</li>
                    <li><strong>Land Use:</strong> An area larger than China is used to grow food that is never eaten,
                        contributing to deforestation and habitat loss</li>
                    <li><strong>Biodiversity Loss:</strong> Agricultural expansion for wasted food destroys ecosystems
                        and threatens wildlife</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Degradation:</strong> Excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides in food
                        production that goes to waste damages soil quality and pollutes waterways</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Economic Impact</h3>
            <div class="about-tips">
                <p>Food waste represents a massive economic burden at every level:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Household Costs:</strong> The average family wastes $1,500-$2,000 worth of food annually
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Business Losses:</strong> Retailers and food service businesses lose billions in
                        inventory and disposal costs</li>
                    <li><strong>National Economics:</strong> Countries lose significant GDP through food waste,
                        affecting economic productivity</li>
                    <li><strong>Waste Management:</strong> Municipal governments spend billions on collecting and
                        disposing of food waste</li>
                    <li><strong>Lost Investment:</strong> All the resources invested in producing wasted food—labor,
                        seeds, fuel, equipment—represent lost economic value</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Social Impact</h3>
            <div class="about-tips">
                <p>Food waste has profound implications for food security and social equity:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Global Hunger:</strong> 828 million people face hunger daily, while enough food is
                        wasted to feed 2 billion people</li>
                    <li><strong>Food Insecurity:</strong> Even in wealthy nations, millions struggle with food access
                        while tons of edible food go to waste</li>
                    <li><strong>Nutritional Impact:</strong> Wasted food includes nutrient-rich items like fruits,
                        vegetables, and proteins that vulnerable populations desperately need</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Inequality:</strong> Food waste highlights disparities between those with excess
                        and those without enough</li>
                    <li><strong>Community Resources:</strong> Food waste diverts resources that could be used for
                        education, healthcare, and poverty reduction</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                    <p>Image: Malaysia's food waste challenge and statistics</p>
                </div>

                <p>Malaysia faces its own significant food waste crisis:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>38,000 Tons Daily:</strong> Malaysia generates approximately 38,000 tons of food waste
                        per day</li>
                    <li><strong>Landfill Crisis:</strong> Food waste comprises 45% of solid waste in Malaysian landfills
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Economic Loss:</strong> An estimated RM13.5 billion worth of food is wasted annually in
                        Malaysia</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural Factors:</strong> Large gatherings, buffet culture, and festive celebrations
                        contribute to significant waste</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>The Path Forward</h3>
            <div class="about-facts">
                <p>
                    Reducing food waste is one of the most impactful actions we can take to address climate change,
                    conserve resources, and feed more people. Small changes in our daily habits—like better meal
                    planning,
                    proper food storage, and supporting food rescue organizations—can make a tremendous difference.

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                    <strong>The good news?</strong> Solutions exist at every level, from individual actions to policy
                    changes.
                    By understanding the problem and taking action, we can create a more sustainable and equitable food
                    system
