                <h3>Smart Shopping Strategies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a meal plan before shopping to buy only what you need</li>
                    <li>Make a detailed shopping list and stick to it—avoid impulse purchases</li>
                    <li>Shop your fridge and pantry first to use what you already have</li>
                    <li>Buy "ugly" or imperfect produce—it's just as nutritious and flavorful</li>
                    <li>Avoid bulk purchases unless you're certain you'll use everything</li>
                    <li>Check expiration dates and choose products you'll use soonest</li>
                    <li>Shop more frequently with smaller trips to buy fresher food</li>
                    <li>Don't shop when hungry—you'll buy more than you need</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Proper Food Storage</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Store potatoes, onions, and garlic in cool, dark, dry places—not the fridge</li>
                    <li>Keep herbs fresh by storing them upright in water like flowers</li>
                    <li>Separate bananas from other fruits—they release ethylene gas that speeds ripening</li>
                    <li>Wrap celery and broccoli in foil to keep them crisp for weeks</li>
                    <li>Store leafy greens with a paper towel to absorb excess moisture</li>
                    <li>Use airtight containers to extend the life of leftovers and produce</li>
                    <li>Freeze bread, herbs, and overripe fruits for later use</li>
                    <li>Organize your fridge with older items in front using "first in, first out"</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Understanding Date Labels</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Best Before" means quality may decline, but food is still safe to eat</li>
                    <li>"Use By" indicates the last date for optimal safety—follow this for meat and dairy</li>
                    <li>Most foods are safe beyond these dates—trust your senses (smell, look, taste)</li>
                    <li>Canned goods can last years past the printed date if stored properly</li>
                    <li>Eggs are typically good for 3-5 weeks after purchase</li>
                    <li>Dairy products often last a week or more past "best before" dates</li>
                    <li>Dry goods like pasta and rice can last indefinitely if kept dry</li>
                </ul>
